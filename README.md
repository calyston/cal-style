# Cal Style

I made this collection of HTML elements, JavaScript and CSS stylings to make setting up projects easier for myself.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Key Features

Page Container: The "page-container" class is used to give whitespace at the edges of a page, so that the content is not the entire width of the page. This is set to be as wide as 1200px. This is best used with the "section" tag as the "section" tag can be used to envelope all elements on a web page. 

Article: The "article" tag is used for sections of your web page. It gives spacing above and below the article so that your sections are nicely spaced out.

Navigation: The navigation is already set up and styled to be a basic navigation layout. The "nav-container" class is used to hold all contents of the navigation bar, such as logo, navigation links, and/or a mobile menu. The "nav-links" class is used to style the navigation links. The id "logo" is pre-styled to fit nicely within the navigation bar.

Button: The "button" tag is pre-styled so that at the least all that is needed is a colour change.

Forms: The "form", "input" and "text-area" tags are pre-styled for ease of usage.
